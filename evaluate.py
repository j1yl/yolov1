# TODO: implement evaluation metrics i.e. mAP and compare against the original YOLO v1 paper results
# https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.02640

# Run the training script (python train.py)
# Implement evaluation metrics in a new file (e.g., evaluate.py)
# Run evaluation on the validation set
# Collect all statistics (training loss, mAP, training time)
# Create visualizations (loss curves, mAP values)
# Write your 1-page report with all the required information
